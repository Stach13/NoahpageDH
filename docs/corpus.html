       <h2>Comparison of the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings</h2>

                </figure>
                
                <p class="box">Though the diction and style used in the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales are different than the Lord of the Rings, 
                    they all tell stories of adventures. In the N-gram chart you can see that difference 
                    between how many times “the sons of feanor” is used versus all the rest.</p>
                
                <figure>

                </figure>
            
                <p class="box">In this method, I adjusted the ngram count to 3 instead of 4 with "the sons of feanor"
                statement. This displays twice the frequency using "the sons of", which could leads others to believe that there were 
                either a lot more than one group of "the sons of" or there was another "the sons of" who's tale is told just as frequent
                as the "sons of feanor".</p>

                <p class="box">Both novels use the same sort of descriptive language style to explain specific details in the books.
                In this example, under the KWIC (or Keywords in Context using Antconc) I found a prepositional phrase "the edge of the"
                which was one of the top ten listed under n-gram size 4. The KWIC shows exactly how descriptive each sentence is written, pulling 
                a list of various samples. On the left Context it seems that words "to, from, toward, near, etc" show inferences of location. 
                While the Right Context displays the exact connection between all three categories, with all the starting words containing nouns after the phrase
                was used.</p>

                    <figcaption>Shows KWIC of the phrase in the Silmarillion</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p class="box">In this KWIC example, taken from the Silmarillion, it appears that many groups of words describe 
                people or legions of people more often in the Silmarillion than in the Lord of the Rings. With many of the the Left Context nouns having close relations
                with the Hit phrase itself. Left Context ends with mostly a prepostional phrase heading into the Hit. The Right Context starts with mostly 
                verbs such as "hearken, was, are, established, arise, etc." as well as prounouns such as "they and that".</p>

                <p class="box">Using Voyant Tools software I was able to pull information about every word, phrase, and character
                about the Fellowship of the Ring. One of the panels in the software is the Cirrus Cloud, which pulled all the most relevant words 
                in the novel. When hovering over the text with your cursor a preview pops up with the specific word count. It appears that many of the main characters are used the most, such as "Frodo, Sam, and Gandalf." 
                Therefore, you can make the observation that the novel presents perspective of each of the characters, with one of the most used words "said."</p>

                </figure>
                
                <P class="box">In this cluster, same as with the Fellowship, I pulled the entire text of The Silmarillion and examined the cirrus panel again. 
                Using the exact same amount of terms allowed in the cirrus. One distinction I saw with this text over the Fellowship was that many words generated concepts or connectivity with groups of
                people and places on Middle Earth rather than displaying a personal account about each character in the novel from a third person perspective. I think by using this structure, 
                you can hypothesize that the Silmarillion contains a variety of stories and definitely acts like a history book about Middle Earth and Arda.</P>

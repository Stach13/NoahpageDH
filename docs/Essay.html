            <h3>Two Sites Reflection</h3>
            
            <p>In the past, for me it was always difficult being able to learn and implement new technological skills. In terms of creating a website for my portfolio of all the other digital content I created, 
            I found the challenge to be somewhat arduous despite the fact it wasn't my first time constructing a website in html. 
            Out of the two websites I created, I would 
            consider the Wordpress site to be drastically faster to grasp than my GitHub site. On my GitHub site, I had to re-learn and recognize new elements, attributes, and identifiers, 
            as well as learn how to stylize with CSS (though it didn't take me very long to utilize some of the basic containers in the language). 
            For the average person learning how to develop a website for the first time, 
            I think they would find it more challenging to pickup the basics in 
            html/css than using a web program that writes the site for them.Â  In my opinion, I feel there are significant advantages to writing a site using a personal GitHub repository. 
            A repository, essentially takes files that are on your computer and uploads them to the internet, 
            which can later be stored and embedded into a website. 
            With GitHub and a good text editor there's no limitations to what you can and can't develop. 
            On the other hand, Wordpress does have those limitations and only gives you a 
            finite amount of tools and resources to use. It's use of visual interface makes developing a website much less versatile.</p>
            
            <p>For me, one of the many challenges in modifying the layout and organization of both sites, is essentially writing the structure. 
            For example, in my GitHub page, most of the times I have to worry about how each element and attribute is parented or linked to each other. With my WordPress it's not really intensive as it is annoying. 
            Without being able to override the visual interface, it's hard to maintain the framework or 
            display of my media with elements such as headers or titles in the way I want them to look. Generally, I believe two of the most important skills you need to obtain in order to make these types of sites is creativity and passion. 
            For you to learn something like coding websites or understanding a web engines tools takes a certain amount of drive and creativity. 
            Someone who is unenthusiastic about making digital content, will not devote their time to it. 
            Learning from other experienced people or from other advisable websites and utilizing there templates in a repetitious way, 
            will gradually give you first hand knowledge of how a document can be structured. For the future, one of the skills 
            I want to learn about in order to make my website look more professional, is learning all the ins and outs of stylizing and its association with particular markup. 
            For example, being able to associate the html "nav and its child p class='inset'" 
            and incorporating them into my css code as two different identifiers with containers, is something that I want to learn more about.</p>

                 <p><i>A recap of the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester NY. I'm so fortunate that I had the ability to work with the PGA Digital team at this most historic tournament. Unfortunately, I was unable to capture any of Michael Block's stunning performance, but was able to include coverage of Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka, and Viktor Hovland.

            <p><i>This film was mostly made by me and one other student. Some other people were able to contribute as well through production and casting too. The film essentially illustrates 
            the quest for the feelings of pleasure and happiness in the life of the main character, Jimmy (Connor McQuiston). The film starts out 
            with him unsatisfied with the direction and overall routine of his daily 
            life until he stumbles upon an unusual atmospheric state of consciousness. One thing to note, color grading the Raw RED footage was sort of complicated within a two week deadline window.</i></p>

                and what we can do as a society to change where and how we view films. And yes, I did add a voice bit from a podcast featuring Tarantino's opinion about movie theatres.</i></p>

 <!-- 2022-10-07 ebb: I made a few corrections so your HTML is valid. 
    1. Your <head> element was wrapping around the whole document, so that was a problem. I just moved the end tag back.
    2. Your <template> element was not inside the body element. I'm not sure why you're using <template> here: it's for specialized
    coding usually to work with JavaScript. I'd replace it with <nav> since that better describes the content (your navigation bar).

                    since that is how it is named and stored in your GitHub repo.
                    No need to change anything else! 
                    See if this works on GitHub Pages. -->
